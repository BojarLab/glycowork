# Changelog

## [1.6.0]
- All glycan graphs are now directed graphs (`nx.Graph` --> `nx.DiGraph`), flowing from the root (reducing end) to the tips (non-reducing ends), which has led to code changes in quite few functions. Some functions run faster now, yet outputs are unaffected (03dfad6)
- Added `huggingface_hub>=0.16.0` as a new dependency to facilitate more robust model distribution (22f6b8f)
- Moved `drawSvg~=2.0`, `Pillow`, and `openpyxl` from the optional `[draw]` install to the dependencies of base glycowork. That allows for the usage of `GlycoDraw` in, e.g., Jupyter environments etc, even if `glycowork[draw]` has not been installed. Since these dependencies are unproblematic, no special install needs to be followed for the base glycowork install (60e51da)
- Deprecated the optional `[draw]` install completely, by replacing the problematic `cairosvg` dependency with our new & custom renderer `glycorender`, which is now a new base dependency of `glycowork` (7c4fbe1)

## glycan_data
#### loader
##### Added ‚ú®
- Added `HashableDict` class to allow for caching of functions with dicts as inputs (03dfad6)

##### Changed üîÑ
- Refined motif definition of `Internal_LewisX`/`Internal_Lewis_A`/`i_antigen` in `motif_list`, to exclude `LewisY`/`LewisB`/`I_antigen` from matching/overlapping (07c9c12)
- Renamed `Hyluronan` in `motif_list` into `Hyaluronan` (07c9c12)
- Removed `Nglycolyl_GM2` from `motif_list`; it's captured by `GM2` (07c9c12)
- Further curated glycomics datasets stored in `glycomics_data_loader` by introducing the b1-? --> b1-3/4 narrow linkage ambiguities (9eeaa3a, 436bf09)
- `download_model` will now download model weights and representations from the HuggingFace Hub (22f6b8f)

### motif
#### processing
##### Added ‚ú®
- GlyTouCanIDs are now another supported nomenclature in the context of Universal Input and can be used as inputs for functions etc, supported via improvements in `canonicalize_iupac` (eafb218)
- Added `sanitize_iupac` to detect and fix chemical impossibilities (like two monosaccharides connected via the same hydroxyl group) and fix it (407cd6f, 74d35a0)
- Added `GLYCAN_MAPPINGS` dictionary to map commonly used glycan names to their IUPAC-condensed sequence (36d33b8)
- Added `linearcode1d_to_iupac` to support sequences of type `01Y41Y41M(31M21M21M)61M(31M21M)61M21M` in the Universal Input platform

##### Changed üîÑ
- Moved `.motif.query.glytoucan_to_glycan` into `.motif.processing` (eafb218)
- `canonicalize_iupac` will now use `sanitize_iupac` to auto-fix chemical impossibilities in input glycans (407cd6f)
- More GlycoWorkBench sequence variants can now be handled via `glycoworkbench_to_iupac`/`canonicalize_iupac` (9eeaa3a, 436bf09, 74d35a0)
- More supported WURCS2 tokens (436bf09, 84c5bcc)
- `canonicalize_iupac` and most glycowork functions now also support common names, like "LacNAc" or "2'-FL", in the Universal Input framework, thanks to `GLYCAN_MAPPINGS` (36d33b8, ab42dbb)
- `get_class` can now identify repeating unit glycans and returns "repeat" in this case (74d35a0)
- `canonicalize_iupac` can now handle even more IUPAC-dialects, like `aMan13(aMan16)Man`, where the anomeric state is declared before the monosaccharide (24c8e81, ab42dbb)
- `canonicalize_iupac` will now use `glycan_to_nxGraph` and `graph_to_string` for branch canonicalization, instead of `choose_correct_isoform`. On average, this works much better and is more reliable (7c52a0e)
- `canonicalize_iupac` is now more robust to (5-6) type linkages and to the associated sugar alcohols, like Rib5P-ol (7a260ac)
- `canonicalize_iupac` will now raise a `ValueError` instead of a warning if a glycan string has mismatching brackets (b69fced)

##### Deprecated ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Deprecated `find_isomorphs` and `choose_correct_isoform`; this will be done (and better) by the new `canonicalize_glycan_graph` instead (7c52a0e)

#### annotate
##### Changed üîÑ
- Renamed `clean_up_heatmap` to `deduplicate_motifs` (407cd6f)
- Allow sets of glycans as inputs in `get_k_saccharides`, in addition to lists of glycans (74d35a0)
- Made `get_k_saccharides` faster by re-using graphs and using the directed graphs in an optimized way (7c52a0e)

##### Fixed üêõ
- Fixed an edge case in `get_k_saccharides`, in which choosing a `size` larger than the size of the largest glycan in the input caused an error (db7847d)
- Fixed `get_k_saccharides` with higher values of `size`, which occasionally produced invalid strings, by refactoring `count_unique_subgraphs_of_size_k` and switching it to use the changed `graph_to_string_int`, to ensure motif validity (db7847d)

##### Deprecated ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Deprecated `link_find`; will be done by an optimized `get_k_saccharides` instead (since `link_find` relied on `find_isomorphs`) (7c52a0e)

#### draw
##### Added ‚ú®
- Added `get_branches_from_graph` to process directed glycan graphs into components for `GlycoDraw` (e56d015)
- Added the `reverse_highlight` keyword argument to `GlycoDraw`, if you want to highlight everything *except* a certain motif (which means you can highlight discontiguous sequence stretches) (f5e3b2f)

##### Changed üîÑ
- Quantitative highlighting in `GlycoDraw` via the `per_residue` keyword argument will now use individual SNFG-colors instead of a uniform highlight color (07c9c12)
- Refactored `get_coordinates_and_labels` to be more efficient and generalizable; with this and the new `get_branches_from_graph`, `GlycoDraw` is now capable of drawing even more complex structures accurately (e56d015, 36fbba9)
- Next to `.svg` and `.pdf`, it is now also possible to save `.png` files with `GlycoDraw` (36fbba9)
- `display_svg_with_matplotlib` now has the optional `chem` keyword argument to alert our renderer that the .svg comes from RDKit (7c4fbe1)

##### Deprecated ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Deprecated `split_node`, `unique`, `get_indices`, `split_monosaccharide_linkage`, and `glycan_to_skeleton`, since this will now be handled by the changed `get_coordinates_and_labels` (e56d015)

#### graph
##### Added ‚ú®
- Added `canonicalize_glycan_graph` to reorder graph nodes in either a length-first or linkage-first manner (7c52a0e)
- `graph_to_string` and its sub-functions now have new keyword arguments: `canonicalize`, to determine whether transcribed graphs should be re-ordered into a canonicalized IUPAC-condensed and `order_by` to decide whether canonicalization happens in a length-first or linkage-first manner (7c52a0e)
- Added `glycan_graph_memoize` decorator to cache results from `graph_to_string_int` (db7847d)

##### Changed üîÑ
- Switched `lru_cache` from `glycan_to_graph` to `glycan_to_nxGraph_int` for better performance and fewer opportunities to mess with the cache (03dfad6)
- Made `graph_to_string` faster, to accommodate its more central role in the Universal Input framework (7c52a0e)
- Added a fast-return for disaccharide graphs in `graph_to_string_int`, since no canonicalization/branch sorting is needed (db7847d)
- `subgraph_isomorphism` is now also fine with people prodiving a separate `termini_list` even when providing graphs as input (though it's still recommended to just input `termini_list` when creating the graphs in the first place) (7a260ac)
- `GlycoDraw` will now properly space text within monosaccharide symbols, if there are multiple indicators (like `D` and `f`) (03e502c)
- `get_possible_topologies` will now raise a `ValueError` instead of a warning when you attempt to use it with an already defined glycan (b69fced)
- `get_possible_topologies` will now by default return the strings of glycans, except if `return_graphs=True`, in which case the old behavior of returning glycan graphs as NetworkX objects is restored (b69fced)
- If `get_possible_topologies` is used with dangling modifications (e.g., `{OS}Gal(b1-3)GalNAc`), the new default is now to also try adding the modification at non-terminal residues, even if `exhaustive=False`. The behavior for monosaccharide additions is unchanged. (b69fced)
- If a glycan string is input into `graph_to_string` (even though you shouldn't do this) it will simply be returned as the string value (b69fced)

##### Fixed üêõ
- Fixed an edge case in `compare_glycans` in which two identical string glycans returned (True, True) if `return_matches == False` (03dfad6)

#### tokenization
##### Changed üîÑ
- `stemify_glycan` can now deal with even more strongly modified glycans and should be faster too (03e502c)
